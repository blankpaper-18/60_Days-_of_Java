# 60_Days-_of_Java

This repository contains my notes, code, and practice projects from “60 Days of Java: The Complete Java Masterclass”, a course that takes you from Java basics to building real applications with JavaFX and Spring Boot.​

Over 60 days, the course starts with core Java fundamentals (variables, data types, control flow, loops, arrays, user input) and then moves into object‑oriented programming, exceptions, collections, and file handling so you really understand how Java works under the hood. Later sections focus on building desktop apps with JavaFX, creating REST APIs with Spring Boot, working with databases, and adding security features like authentication and role‑based access.​

The main hands‑on projects are a To‑Do desktop application built with JavaFX and a full Expense Tracker built with Spring Boot and REST APIs, where you connect to a database, handle users, and apply clean‑code and best‑practice patterns. Along the way, the course also covers Git/GitHub, concurrency and threads, and how to package your apps as sharable JAR files.​

This repo is mainly for learning and revision: daily exercises, small code experiments, and project code as I move through the 60‑day roadmap. It’s a work in progress, but if you’re also learning Java, you might find the structure, commits, and code examples helpful to follow or adapt for your own practice.​
